TestNG: TestNG is a unit testing framework. (Testing new generation framework)
Purpose: 
  1. TestNG is used to design your test cases in a proper manner or we can say in a systematic way.
  
Advantages:
  1. TestNG is a open source tool so no licensing will be required to use testNG.
  2. TestNg gives different types of annotations to design test cases.
  3. Using TestNG we can priorities the test cases using priority keyword.
  4. Using TestNG we can clubbed the test cases into a groups and then execute the test cases based on groups.
  5. TestNG provides @parameter annotation , so with that we can pass any function parameter using @parameter annotation.
  6. TestNG provides dependency so using that we can do one test case depends on another test case using depends on method.
  7. TestNG provides @DataProvider annotation so using that we can keep the data outside and use them while testing.
  8. TestNG generates a good html report.
  9. Using TestNG We can implements retry execution of the test case if its fail in first execution.
  10. Using TestNG we can implement take screenshot feature once the test case fails using testNG listener.
  11. Using TestNG we can implement parallel execution of the test cases.
  12. Using TestNG we can add multiple test into a group using groups keyword.
  13. Using TestNG if one test case is depends on another group same can be achieved by depends on group method.
  14. Invocation count : TestNG supports invocation count if same test case is executed multiple times using invocation count keyword.
